# Treetop Jump
An unfinished sequel to my unfinished game: The Birb. I started this project for Hack Club Roulette (https://roulette.hackclub.com/) but I never got far enough to submit it. Later I finished it for Hack Club Athena Award :D [![Athena Award Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Faward.athena.hackclub.com%2Fapi%2Fbadge)](https://award.athena.hackclub.com?utm_source=readme)

This was made in Godot with a little bit of Blender and pixel art and some help from random youtube tutorials.

_-such a wonderful frankenstien of code-_

Making this game, I learned a lot about 3D Godot and a little more about blender. It was kind of hard to learn the tools with so many features that I don't know how to use, but I got there in the end :)
